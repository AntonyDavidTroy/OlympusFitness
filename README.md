# Olympus Fitness

The intention behind this project is health, fitness and well being! In this project I have used HTML for structure, CSS for the style to make the website more appealing and user-friendly. I have used media queries to make the project responsive on devices of all different sizes.

## UX


This website highlights the facilities of the Olympus Fitness gym. The hours of operations, pricing and facility highlights are listed as this is what potential clients/members care about the most. A Gallery page is presented to help provide with images of the equipment, classes and  the general look of the gym. The website is filled with a good deal of information and also has an equiry form where they can ask any additonal questions that they would like to be ask. I wanted to make the website look attractive to people of all ages. The website has social media links (**Facebook**, **Instagram**, **Twitter** and **Youtube**) so gym members and potential clients can follow and preview what possible services this Gym offers and what could be in store in the future for them.



#### Languages & Techologies


   -HTML
   
   -CSS

#### Color Scheme


   - Dark Grey: #353535
   - Light Grey: #bdb6b6
   
   - The main colours for the website is Dark Grey and Light Grey as I believe these are colours that compliment each other. The background colour is the darker colour, to let the lighter colour with the information stand out but also easy on the eyes without being a too bright and bold. I also used these colours to give a feel of a cool and neutral feelings of the gym to show anyone and everyone would feel welcome.

#### Icons


   - I used icons from a website called 'https://fontawesome.com/' to give the website a up-to-date look when it comes to the contacting information, buttons and the social media links.



#### Template


These are not broken images, they are pdf files, you can click on them and you will be directed to: readme-assets > template images >


## Existing Features


#### Navigation Bar


   - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, About, Gallery and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
   -This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
   -The navigation bar has an active status on, so what page you are currently on the title of that page will be underlined permanently. When your cursor is hovered over any other page titles, they will also be underline, only while you are hovered over it.

  - Featured on all four pages the full responsive footer The section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Olyumpus Fitness.
  - The links will open to a new tab to allow easy and direct navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.

#### Landing Page


 - The landing page includes the logo, navigation bar and a large main photo of the gym to gibe the users a good idea of what the gym looks and feels like. 
    
 - There is a small box included on the main image, giving the user inspiration and motiviation. 
    It is slightly transparent so the user can still see the main image but also clear enough to read the text without conflicting.

#### contact Info On Home Page


  - The contact section on the home page consist of two halfs, the first left half is the basic, yet important information needed to get in touch contact with the gym. Each section has a small header with an icon next to make it look up to date and use-friendly without being too fancy.
   
  - The second right half contains an image of google maps which shows the location of the gym and surrounding areas.

#### Membership Options


   - In the section of the membership options, the user will see three big options for the gym, all containing the pricing, what facilities they would receieve and any additonal fees that could be included.
    
  - Each box has the same background colour as the main background to blend in, however when the use will hover their cursor over the options.
   
  - The background color and the text color will swap to give it more of an appealing, but soft look.
    
  - I added a curved border on the edges to give it a smooth look so that the option boxes doesn't look plain and 'blocky'.
    
  - I gave a good amount of spacing between each box and each part of information in the option boxes so that the information is not cluttered or squashed together.

  - I have placed a link styled as a button underneath the membership options that becomes underline when hovered over to let the user know and have the option to be one click away to get into contact with the gym. It also has a small text to give the user encouragement to click.

#### Classes


  - The different options of classes are styled the same as the membership option boxes to give the user the same feel through the page and the whole website.
  
  - Each individual classes box has a title of the class workout and a small description of what kind of exercise would be involved in it.

#### Timetable


   - At the bottom of the page after seeing the classes, I placed a timetable containing all the information for what day the classes are on, at what time and what day.
   
   - I gave plently of space in each grid of the timetable to make sure the user isn't struggling to read the text between all the horizontal and vertical bordered that keep the information structure.
   
   - I have place a button underneath the timetable which contains a downloadable image of the timetable for the user to download and keep saved on the device just incase of any network issues that they could potentially have with their device. e.g. no service on the users mobile device.
   
   -  The timetable also scrolls from left to right when the device becomes too small to fit all on one page without looking distorted.

#### Gallery 


  - In this page it contains of images equally spaced between each other to give the user an easy experience when browsing through the images. Whem the cursor is hovered over an image, the image will get a curved border like the ones in the class boxes and membership options to keep everything consistent.
  
  - The gallery will also provide the user with supporting images to see what gym equipment is available, what the classes look like if the user were to join, it also show what the gym looks like inside.
  
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify what needs the user are looking for cand if they be fulfilled at the gym.

#### Google Maps
 
 - This section contains an interactive google maps for the user to be able to get directions instantly to the gym and help find their way with local buildings if they were to struggle to find it.

#### Get In Touch

 - This section is important as it contains contact information for the user and also an enquiry form if they have any questions.
 
 - I made each text field required so that the user will have to fill out each field. I made certain field have specific inputs to help from any errors that the user may accidently make when filling in the form.
 
 - I made sure to ask for all the right information in the form so that when the user is contacted back, the gym will have their correct name, number, email for when they reply to the users enquiy.

## Features Left To Implement

  - Possibly a live chat button where the user can speak directly to a member of staff which can give prompt responses to the user.

## Validator Testing

  - HTML
      - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fantonydavidtroy.github.io%2FOlympusFitness%2F)
  - CSS
     -  No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fantonydavidtroy.github.io%2FOlympusFitness%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
 

## Issues

  - After finishing the website the first issue I had was the images in the Gallery page were getting bigger when hovered, but it also kicked all other images out of alignment. I fixed this by changing the 'max-height' to 'height' and it solved it.
  
  - The second issue I had with this website was the timetable could be scrolled up and down aswell as left and right, it made it look pretty tacky, so after that I changed the overflow to overflow-x. This solved this issue for me.
  
  - My third issue was when I was using devices with smaller screens alot of images kept appearing stretched, I had to keep changing the heights of the images, so as the screens got smaller I had to change the height of the images between certain sizes of screens.
  
  - After finally finishing I realised I didn't put a title about the enquiry form and contact info in the Contact page. So I simply added a title above with was central to keep that professional look.
  
## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
