# Olympus Fitness

## Milestone 1 Project

The intention behind this project is health, fitness and well being! In this project I have used HTML for structure, CSS for the style to make the website more appealing and user-friendly. I have used media queries to make the project responsive on devices of all different sizes.

## UX

This website highlights the facilities of the Olympus Fitness gym. The hours of operations, pricing and facility highlights are listed as this is what potential clients/members care about the most. A Gallery page is presented to help provide with images of the equipment, classes and  the general look of the gym. The website is filled with a good deal of information and also has an equiry form where they can ask any additonal questions that they would like to be ask. I wanted to make the website look attractive to people of all ages.

#### User Stories

- Users can scroll up and down or use navigation menus for contents they are interested.
- The website has social media links (**Facebook**, **Instagram**, **Twitter** and **Youtube**) so gym members and potential clients can follow and preview what possible services this Gym offers and what could be in store in the future for them.
- Potential gym members can find hours of operation, membership pricing and services easily and can also contact the gym on the 'Contact' page via phone number, email or enquiry form.
- Any user, potential or current member can view the 'Gallery' page to visually see what sort of equipment and classes this gym offers.
- New and existing users can see the location of the gym by zooming in on a google map section I have place on the 'Home' and 'Contact' page for easy access. The one on the 'Contact' page is interactive so they can get instant directions and familiarise themselves with the area.
- On the 'About' page, all the membership options and classes box colors swap to give it an eye catching looking when hovering over the box with the mouse.
- At the bottom of the 'About' Page there is a timetable to show what classes are on throughout the week to help current and potential new members with planning our their lifestyle. Underneath the timetable there is a button to download the timetable to keep on your device incase of not having any internet access. The timetable also scrolls from left to right when the device becomes too small to fit all on one page without looking distorted.


#### Languages & Framework

   -HTML
   
   -CSS

#### Color Scheme

   - Dark Grey: #353535
   - Light Grey: #bdb6b6
   
   - The main colours for the website is Dark Grey and Light Grey as I believe these are colours that compliment each other. The background colour is the darker colour, to let the lighter colour with the information stand out but also easy on the eyes without being a too bright and bold. I also used these colours to give a feel of a cool and neutral feelings of the gym to show anyone and everyone would feel welcome.

#### Icons

   - I used icons from a website called 'https://fontawesome.com/' to give the website a up-to-date look when it comes to the contacting information, buttons and the social media links.

#### Navigation Bar

   - Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, About, Gallery and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
   -This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
   -The navigation bar has an active status on, so what page you are currently on the title of that page will be underlined permanently. When your cursor is hovered over any other page titles, they will also be underline, only while you are hovered over it.
