# Olympus Fitness

## Milestone-1 Project

The intention behind this project is health, fitness and well being! In this project I have used HTML for structure, CSS for the style to make the website more appealing and user-friendly. I have used media queries to make the project responsive on devices of all different sizes.

## User-Stories

This website highlights the facilities of the Olympus Fitness gym. The hours of operations, pricing and facility highlights are listed at the as that is what potential clients/members care about the most. A Gallery page is presented to help provide with images of the equipment, classes and  the general look of the gym. The website is filled with a good deal of information and also has an equiry form where they can ask any additonal questions that they would like to be ask. I wanted to make the website look attractive to people of all ages.
